# why learning python
Python is a great language to learn, whether it’s your first time programming or not, for several reasons:

It reads like plain English! This is something you can especially appreciate with a side-by-side. Take a look and, without worrying about what these code bits actually do, think about which is harder to read:
Python is a great language to learn, whether it’s your first time programming or not, for several reasons:

It reads like plain English! This is something you can especially appreciate with a side-by-side. Take a look and, without worrying about what these code bits actually do, think about which is harder to read:

## STRINGS & CONSOLE OUTPUT

Escaping characters
'There\'s a snake in my boot!'

access by index
```
fifth_letter = "MONTY"[4]

print fifth_letter
#Y
```

string methods:

len()
lower()
upper()
str()
```
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print len(parrot)
#14
print parrot.lower()
print parrot.upper()
#NORWEGIAN BLUE
```


## syntax
recap
```
skill_completed = "Python Syntax"
exercises_completed = 13
#The amount of points for each exercise may change, because points don't exist yet
points_per_exercise = 5
point_total = 100
point_total += exercises_completed*points_per_exercise

print("I got "+str(point_total)+" points!")
#I got 165 points!
pi = 3.14
print str(pi)
#3.14
```
String Concatenation
You know about strings, and you know about arithmetic operators. Now let’s combine the two!

print "Life " + "of " + "Brian"
This will print out the phrase Life of Brian.




string use the + to add two string together
#this sign to comment
update the variable to write new variable in the front
```
v
```
Arithmetic
```
mirthful_addition = 12381 + 91817
amazing_subtraction = 981 - 312
trippy_multiplication = 38 * 902
happy_division = 540 / 45
sassy_combinations = 129 * 1345 + 120 / 6 - 12
```

```
cucumbers = 3
price_per_cucumber = 3.25

total_cost = cucumbers * price_per_cucumber
print total_cost
# 9.75
```

two types of division
```
quotient1 = 7./2
# the value of quotient1 is 3.5
quotient2 = 7/2.
# the value of quotient2 is 3.5
quotient3 = 7./2.
# the value of quotient3 is 3.5
An alternative way is to use the float() method:

quotient1 = float(7)/2 
# the value of quotient1 is 3.5
```

```
cucumbers = 100
num_people = 6

whole_cucumbers_per_person = cucumbers/num_people
print whole_cucumbers_per_person

float_cucumbers_per_person = float(cucumbers)/num_people
print float_cucumbers_per_person
#16
#16.6666667
```

Multi-line Strings

We have seen how to define a string with single quotes and with double quotes. If we want a string to span multiple lines, we can also use triple quotes:

address_string = """136 Whowho Rd
Apt 7
Whosville, WZ 44494"""

bollean
```
age_is_12 = False
name_is_maria = True
```

convert str and int
```
We can do that using str():

age = 13
print "I am " + str(age) + " years old!"
This would print:

>>> "I am 13 years old!"
Similarly, if we have a string like "7" and we want to perform arithmetic operations on it, we must convert it to a numeric datatype. We can do this using int():

number1 = "100"
number2 = "10"

string_addition = number1 + number2 
#string_addition now has a value of "10010"

int_addition = int(number1) + int(number2)
#int_addition has a value of 110

If you use int() on a floating point number, it will round the number down. To preserve the decimal, you can use float():

string_num = "7.5"
print int(string_num)
print float(string_num)
>>> 7
>>> 7.5
```



## 

Write your name, why you want to learn python and an interesting fact about you.

REBECCA LOWRY- I did a unit at night school on it and had 4 hours to learn and do an assignment, i never really got the grips of it. so im just here to gain more understanding. interesting fact: i play the drums 
guy- explains game
guy asks girl- pick a number between 1 and 100
girl guesses number
number is wrong
guesses again - wrong
guesses again- correct 



Steve - upskill and learn how to program to make cool stuff - Something interesting about me: I like to spearfish 
Instructions exeplained. bottom and upper number set. 
girl guesses number around the middle
guy advises that number is too high
girl guesses lower number
Guy advises it is too high
girl guesses a number slightly lower
guy advises number is still too low
Guys advises the correct number

Bhuvan Sharma- upskilling myself with new programming language. I have a lovely daughter.
Guess the number between 1 and 100
Number can be greater or Smaller from the expected num
Guess number was smaller than the expected number so the hint was given a little higher
next guess was a bit higher so the hint got a little lower
..
..
..
in the end the expected number was met.

Phoebe Snep, so I can be more employable and it seems interesting, I grew up at a winery. 
Guessing the number 
1. Explain how the game works 
2. P1 thinks of a number between 1-100
3. P2 Guesses what the number is 
4. P1 says their number is higher 
5. P2 guesses between that number and 100
6. P1 Advises that their number is lower
7. P2 guesses between the two numbers 
8. P1 advises again 
9. 

Alice Jackson - I want to be a cool girl hacker gamer girl who is insdespensible in my workplace. I spend most of my time/money snowboarding.
Question was posed. Find a value between x and y. Solution is presented and the answer validated as high or lower than the value. Pool of possible numbers is lowered until the correct number is found and validated.

Sarah - for work and my interesting fact is that I...... am currently.... sitting. I dabble in some hobbies including oil painting and beating by boyfriend at sum sudoku.
prompt with qualifiers - guess a number between 1 and 100
answer
instruct  higher lower
answer
instruct higher lower
tell answer

Masha - I want to learn python for career in marketing and business analytics / lived in 3 different countries within the last 3 years

1. Ask for a number between 1 and 100
guess
2. Say if the number >< or = the guess 1 
guess 2
3. Say if the number >< or = the guess 2 
guess 3

Melani Anggraeni- My degree doesn't support my need in technical skills in coding as much. Interesting fact: I used to be able to see ghosts when i was a kid and interested in paranormal investigation videos. 
1. Instruction/ explain rules 
2. Volunteer guess
3. Take in the guess and determine whether it's closer and further away
4. Guess again if answer not correct
5. Take the guess 
6. If answer is correct, game over 

Charm - I 'm new to learning data science and python is in my list to study.
1. choose a number from a given range
2. check if number equals to the number to guess
3. if not, say if lower or higher
4. pick another number between the new range
5. repeat until the number is correct
